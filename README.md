# Simple AI Classifier Project

## Project Title
A Basic Machine Learning Classifier for Predicting Categories

## Summary
This project is a small demonstration of how an AI model can classify simple data.  
The goal is to show how machine learning works using a clear and easy-to-understand example.

## Background
AI is used today to classify many kinds of information—such as messages, images, or measurements.  
I chose this project because I want to learn how models make predictions and how we can evaluate their accuracy.  
Understanding basic classifiers is important because they are the foundation of more advanced AI systems.

## How is it used?
After training, the model can take new input data and decide which category it belongs to.  
A simple example is predicting whether something is type A or type B based on a few input features.

## Data sources and AI methods
The dataset can be any small, labeled dataset—for example, sample numbers arranged into two categories.  
The AI method used could be:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Simple Neural Network  

These methods help the model learn patterns from the input features.

## Challenges
The main challenges include:
- Ensuring there is enough training data  
- Avoiding overfitting  
- Choosing the right evaluation metrics  

These issues are common in most machine learning projects.

## What next?
The project could be improved by:
- Adding more features to the dataset  
- Testing multiple algorithms and comparing results  
- Visualizing the decision boundaries of the model  

This would make the classifier more accurate and more useful.
